## What's for
SDWebImageLottiePlugin is a plugin for [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/) framework, which provide the [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) animation loading from JSON file.

You can find more resource about Lottie in their [Official Site](https://airbnb.design/lottie/).

## Requirements

+ iOS 11+
+ macOS 10.11+
+ tvOS 11+
+ Xcode 11+

## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

SDWebImageWebPCoder is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager).

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageLottiePlugin.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ]
)
```

#### CocoaPods

SDWebImageLottiePlugin is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'SDWebImageLottiePlugin', '~> 1.0'
```

#### Carthage (Deprecated)

SDWebImageLottiePlugin is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

```
github "SDWebImage/SDWebImageLottiePlugin", ~> 1.0
```

Note:
1. Carthage macOS integration contains issue, because the module name is `Lottie_macOS` but not `Lottie`, wait the issue [here](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/issues/1638) been fixed ðŸ‘€

## Lottie 2 && Objective-C

Lottie 3.4 version's new `Lottie.RenderingEngine = .coreAnimation` solve the huge performance regression in the issue [here](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/issues/895) ðŸš€

So from SDWebImageLottiePlugin v1.0.0, we drop the Lottie 2 support, as well as the Objective-C support because Lottie 3 use pure Swift. And therefore, we drop the iOS 9-10 support because the upstream dependency need iOS 11+.

For user who still use Lottie 2 and Objective-C, please check the 0.x version updated to [0.3.0](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageLottiePlugin/releases/tag/0.3.0)

## Usage

### Load Lottie from remote JSON

+ Swift

```swift
let animationView: Lottie.AnimationView
let lottieJSONURL: URL
animationView.sd_setImage(with: lottieJSONURL)
```

Note:
+ You can also load lottie json files on `AnimatedControl`, like switch button.
+ Lottie animation does not start automatically, you can use the completion block, or UITableView/UICollectionView's will display timing to play.

```swift
animationView.sd_setImage(with: lottieUrl, completed: { _,_,_,_ in
    self.animationView.play(fromProgress: 0, toProgress: 1, loopMode: .repeat(5)) { finished in
        // ...
    }
}
```


+ If your Lottie json files contains references to App bundle images, just set the `imageProvider` before the lottie animation start.

```swift
let bundle = Bundle(for: MyBundleClass.self)
animationView.imageProvider = BundleImageProvider(bundle: bundle, searchPath: nil)
animationView.sd_setImage(with: lottieUrl)
```

### Advanced usage

This Lottie plugin use a wrapper class `LottieImage` because of SDWebImage's [customization architecture design](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#customization). Typically you should not care about this, however this can allows some advanced usage.

+ Swift

```swift
let animation = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Animation.self, from: data)
let animatedImage = LottieImage(animation: animation)
// Optional, custom image bundle
LottieImage.imageProvider = BundleImageProvider(bundle: bundle, searchPath: nil)
// Snapshot Lottie animation frame
let posterFrame = animatedImage.animatedImageFrame(at: 0)
let duration = animatedImage.animatedImageDuration(at: 0)
```

Note:
+ The snapshot is a bitmap version and used for special cases, like thumbnail poster. You'd better not play it on `SDAnimatedImageView`. Because Lottie is a vector animation and `Lottie.AnimationView` use Core Animation for rendering, which is faster.

## Demo

If you have some issue about usage, SDWebImageLottiePlugin provide a demo for iOS && macOS platform. To run the demo, clone the repo and run the following command.

```bash
cd Example/
pod install
open SDWebImageLottiePlugin.xcworkspace
```

After the Xcode project was opened, click `Run` to build and run the demo.
